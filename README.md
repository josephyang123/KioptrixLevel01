# Kioptrix Level 01
// By doing Kioptrix Level 1, we can learn some pen test skills and tools. Learning how to think as a hacker can definitely benefit us when we are on Blue team trying to set up a secure computing evironment for our organization, community, or home system.

## Things I did
// I installed Kioptrix Level one samba in a virtual network, and did pen-test with the kali to learn how an outdated OS can potentially be exploited by malicious users, attackers.
